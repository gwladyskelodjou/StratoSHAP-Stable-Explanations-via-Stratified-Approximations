# StratoSHAP: Stable Explanations via Stratified Approximations

This repository contains the code and experiments for the paper on **StratoSHAP: Stable Explanations via Stratified Approximations**.

The codebase includes several types of cooperative games (machine learning, image-based, and synthetic) and supports multiple approximation methods. The goal is to compare StratoSHAP against existing algorithms such as KernelSHAP, Stratified Sampling, Sobol sampling, and others.

## Installation
We recommend using a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
